migrate_demo_d2d
================

This code was derived from the real-life project [migrate_hrweb](https://github.com/ucb-ist-drupal/migrate_hrweb). It is simplified for the purposes of [this presentation](http://2013.badcamp.net/sessions/migrate-v2-mojo-and-practical-examples). [Here are the slides](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ml9r92rn1pn2fdz/Migrate%20Mojo.pptx).

This is a module for use with [migrate](https://drupal.org/project/migrate) and migrate_d2d.

Git Branches for the Presentation
---------------------------------
This repository has the following remote branches:

    $ git branch
      1-users
      2-taxonomy
      3-files
      4-nodes
      5-nodes
      master

After cloning it down you will be looking at a very boring master
branch.  Beginning with the Migrate Users slide you can do

    git checkout 1-users

to update your repository with the code that enables the users
migration.  The branch 2-taxonomy goes with the slide Migrate
Taxonomy. Etc.
